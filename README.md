# Awesome-Chocolate-Sales-Dashboard

The Awesome Chocolate department transitioned from manual, Excel-based analysis to a Power BI dashboard, enabling real-time insights.

1. Key metrics: Total Sales, Total Cost, Total Profit, Box Shipments.
2. Monthly trends for detailed performance tracking.
3. Product-wise and salesperson-wise analysis via tables.
4. Bookmarks for seamless view switching.

   
This transformation improved efficiency, reduced time, and made sales monitoring highly effective.
